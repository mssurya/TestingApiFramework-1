# TestingApiFramework

This is repository for simple tutorial on building testing api framework.
It is a rip off ..., I mean it is inspired by Mark Winteringham's tutorial Let's Build an API Framework that you can check here:

[Let's Build An API Framework](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/courses/let-s-build-an-api-checking-framework-mark-winteringham).

It is my first real approach of making my own tutorials and you can check my humble creation here:

# Agenda

The real goal of this repository is to improve in testing automation and coding from testers perspective, and start to contribute, cooperate and create content that will inspire testers around the world, a project that will grow and expand and hopefully in the end beats pewdiepie in terms of popularity.
